# ECON 101B - Economic Theory - Macro (Schoefer) - 2022 Fall

Those are note archives as well as very well-structured final review docs I made for my self. I put it here so that you can study it and also I will be able to review it later. So if you found this useful, make sure you star my [repo](https://github.com/ToiletCommander/Opensourced-Study-Notes-Berkeley)

> Additional Note: The credit of most of those notes are due to the instructor (Prof. Benjamin Berthold Schoefer).

> Useful class, but very boring :(
