# EECS 127 - Optimization Models in Engineering (Ranade) - 2022 Fall

Those are note archives as well as very well-structured final review docs I made for my self. I put it here so that you can study it and also I will be able to review it later. So if you found this useful, make sure you star my [repo](https://github.com/ToiletCommander/Opensourced-Study-Notes-Berkeley)

> Additional Note: The credit of most of those notes are due to the instructor (Prof. Gireeja Ranade). A great thank you for prof. Ranade for making this course so enjoyable!
