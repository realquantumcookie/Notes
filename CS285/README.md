# CS 285 - Deep Reinforcement Learning (Levine) - 2022 Fall

Those are note archives as well as very well-structured final review docs I made for my self. I put it here so that you can study it and also I will be able to review it later. So if you found this useful, make sure you star my [repo](https://github.com/ToiletCommander/Opensourced-Study-Notes-Berkeley)

> Additional Note: The credit of most of those notes are due to the instructor (Prof. Sergey Levine) and TAs of this course. Sergey really mastered this material and his lecture slides are very, very clear with his voice-overs. I would recommend you always pause the lecture video and think about the examples/formulas he talked about in the lecture videos.
