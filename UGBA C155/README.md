# UGBA C155 Leadership: Purpose, Authority, and Empowerment (Dan Mulhern & Laura Andersen) - 2022 Summer

Those are note archives I made for my self. I put it here so that you can study it and also I will be able to review it later. So if you found this useful, make sure you star my [repo](https://github.com/ToiletCommander/Opensourced-Study-Notes-Berkeley)

> Pretty useful lecture materials, but the discussions and assignments are just BS.
