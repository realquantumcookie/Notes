# GAN Specialization Notes

Those are note archives as well as very well-structured final review docs I made for my self. I put it here so that you can study it and also I will be able to review it later. So if you found this useful, make sure you star my [repo](https://github.com/ToiletCommander/Opensourced-Study-Notes-Berkeley)   

This is the Generative Adversarial Network [course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-specialization/) provided by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), taught by Sharon Zhou.
