# CS 170 - Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems (Demmel & Nelson) - 2022 Fall

Those are note archives as well as very well-structured final review docs I made for my self. I put it here so that you can study it and also I will be able to review it later. So if you found this useful, make sure you star my [repo](https://github.com/ToiletCommander/Opensourced-Study-Notes-Berkeley)

> Mediocre course, didn't really like it :(
